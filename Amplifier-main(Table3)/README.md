# Amplifier (AAAI 2025)

The repo is the official implementation for the paper: "[**Amplifier: Bringing Attention to Neglected Low-Energy Components in Time Series Forecasting**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17216)".



## Getting Started

### Environment Requirements

To get started, ensure you have Conda installed on your system and follow these steps to set up the environment:

```
conda create -n Amplifier python=3.8
conda activate Amplifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

All the datasets needed for Amplifier can be obtained from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy) provided in Autoformer. 
Create a separate folder named ```./dataset``` and place all the CSV files in this directory. 
**Note**: Place the CSV files directly into this directory, such as "./dataset/ETT-small/ETTh1.csv"

### Training Example

You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
bash ./scripts/ETTm1.sh
bash ./scripts/ETTh1.sh
bash ./scripts/ECL.sh
```
